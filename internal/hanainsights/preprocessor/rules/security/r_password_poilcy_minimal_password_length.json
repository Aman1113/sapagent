It is important to note that the minimal_password_length parameter is critical to enhancing the security of SAP HANA. A password that is shorter than 8 characters is more likely to be guessed or cracked, which could allow an unauthorized user to access your system. To improve the security of your SAP HANA system, we recommend that you increase the value of the minimal_password_length parameter to 8 or more."
