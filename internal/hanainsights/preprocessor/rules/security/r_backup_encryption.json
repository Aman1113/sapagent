  "description": "Encryption status of data and log backups. Encryption protects backups from unauthorized access by encrypting the backup data before it is transferred to the backup location. This means that even if an unauthorized user gains access to the backup data, they will not be able to read it without the decryption key. This is applicable for both file-based backups and backups created using third-party backup tools. Recommendation is to enable backup encryption in the SAP HANA system.",
