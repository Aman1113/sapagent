  "description": "By default, multiple auto merges (up to num_merge_threads) of different tables / partitions can be executed up to a CPU utilization limit of 45%, but as soon as this limit is exceeded, a maximum of one auto merge is executed at any time. This can in the worst case result in an increased auto merge backlog although sufficient system resources for handling parallel auto merges would still be available. In this case you can consider increasing this parameter to a value that is both higher than the usual CPU utilization and lower than a critical limit that would allow auto merges to introduce resource bottlenecks.",
